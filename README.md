# oop-dungeon

Enemy/Item/NPC lists aren't the same as the original, I have removed almost all of the entries.  
I also removed things that might be controversial.  
Originally I made it in Visual Studio, but it shouldn't matter compiled with g++.  
Here I removed all VS files,
and currently has a (bad) makefile to compile the sources.  
This is a perfect representation of bad code and segfaults,
so you may wish to compile without the sanitizers (with your own risk!).  
I might fix the bugs later on...
